• Interpret results accurately and minimise bias in sampling data.



Assessment details


Context


The world has entered a new age of increasingly frequent and intense periods of turbulence. We cannot help but watch events unfold in real time as we try our best to gauge the shockwaves that will impact the global economy. Some sectors and organisations have been devastated (tourism) but others have flourished. Within the video streaming services, this could not be any truer.
Not so long ago, streaming services disrupted the entertainment industry. Now these digital disruptors are being disrupted themselves. Competition between the streaming titans is heating up and the competition for user engagement through increasingly well targeted content has never been higher. An increase in user engagement means more hours of streaming and plenty of opportunities for advertising revenue and therefore company profit.


Business case


Streaming company Why Not Watch? (WNW) has built up a healthy customer base with good content offerings but is continually refining their recommendation engine to provide better recommendations to customers. Better recommendations improve user engagement and importantly increase the average hours watched per user per day, a key metric used to price ads for 3rd party marketing companies.
The executives at WNW want to know if the new recommendation engine algorithm is worth rolling out to all their subscribers. They have asked you to analyse the results from a recent change they made in their recommendation engine and present the results to the executive team.


The sample data


The executives are also interested in any other insights you may learn from the sample data (available to download on the Assessment 3 page in Canvas). In particular, they are curious about the following:


• Is there any bias in the data collection?

• How could any bias be corrected?

• What improvements could be made to future A/B tests?



The sample data shows the effect of an A/B test conducted to measure the effectiveness of a change to the recommendation engine used on some subscribers, but not others. The change to the recommendation went live at 1-minute past midnight on the 18th of July.
Those customers who were unknowingly using the new recommendation engine to suggest what to watch next are labelled as group B, while group A was used as a control group.
The data set has the following fields:

• date in format dd/mm

• gender of the customer

• age of the customer

• social metric, which is a combined metric based on previous viewing habits

• number of months since the customer signed up

• demographic number

• group (A/B) where A is the control and B is the treated group

• number of hours watched in that day
